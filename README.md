PowerGit
========

If you love git and work daily with multiple git repos (even hubs)
then you will this set of PowerGit utility commands. Just pull down
the repo and add this `powergit/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Manage, create, clone, pull, push multiple git repos from the command
line. If you aren't using this (or something like it) you are wasting
time.

More docs later. Read the source for now. Easy stuff.
