PowerGit
========

If you love git and work daily with multiple git repos (even hubs)
then you will this set of PowerGit utility commands. Just pull down
the repo and add this `powergit/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Manage, create, clone, pull, push multiple git repos from the command
line. If you aren't using this (or something like it) you are wasting
time.

More docs later. Read the source for now. Easy stuff.

FAQ
===

**Q: Did you know there is another `powergit` project?**

A: Yes, and I imagine there are a lot of them. They suck---especially the
one about powershell. (OMG, really? I mean, who the fuck uses that crap?

**Q: Aren't you afraid a command like 'save' will conflict?**

A: No. There is no other 'save' in my world (nor in many other power
users world). Git reigns.

**Q: What about the overly simplistic 'save' comment and all the
commits?**

A: If you have a special save make sure you add a comment. Both the
'gsave' and 'save' commands take one. In fact, this allows you to make
ONE comment on multiple repo commits *at the same time from one
command*.
